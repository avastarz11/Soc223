I am thinking about doing my final project on something about consumer data. I am broadly interested in what factors influence consumers' subjective ratings and reviews of products. One dataset I am thinking about is a dataset I found on Kaggle about Sephora consumers' reviews and ratings of different products.

Sophie wants to do something about university rankings and starting salary.

Ava (not me) wants to do something with Spotify.
